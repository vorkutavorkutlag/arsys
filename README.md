## Auomated Reddit Stories for Youtube Shorts

This project uses packages such as asyncpraw, edge TTS, Faster Whisper, moviepy, cv2, etc to find reddit posts from a chosen batch of subreddits, and make shortform tiktokesque videos with subtitles, tts, and background footage & music.

I wrote a detailed list of instructions as for how to use it, however it got deleted. I will write another one whenever I feel happy again.
